        <h3>Cartoon cake</h3>
        <h2>350/- Only</h2>
        <p>Cartoon cakes are the perfect way to impress the children of your house. You can buy fresh and creamy cakes from Giftalove. Here we present you beautiful and designed cakes that also are very tasty. You can choose cartoon cakes online, theme cakes, chocolate cakes, fruit cakes, cupcakes, and many more at very affordable prices. We have an endless list of cakes that will make your occasion happier and more cheerful.  </p>
        <p>I have used Alphonso mangoes (also known as apus/hapus mangoes in India). This was only due to the availability. You can use any kind of full ripened mangoes such as kesari, badami or chaunsa (which we get in the UAE). The flavour and colour of your cake will greatly depend on the sweetness and colour of the mangoes. </p>
