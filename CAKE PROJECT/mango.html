        <h3>Mango cake</h3>

        <p>Mango Cake! Folks I am so thrilled to share the recipe and a video of how I made a simple yet delicious mango cake at home. Over the years I have tried so many different recipes but none satisfied me. Some recipes called for oil instead of butter, some others were without eggs but while they all turned out pretty okay, our tastebuds wanted some more â€“ perhaps the taste of that classic pound cake with the goodness of mangoes. </p>
        <p>I have used Alphonso mangoes (also known as apus/hapus mangoes in India). This was only due to the availability. You can use any kind of full ripened mangoes such as kesari, badami or chaunsa (which we get in the UAE). The flavour and colour of your cake will greatly depend on the sweetness and colour of the mangoes. </p>
